# Manifesto
The BCHDevs group exists to return the Bitcoin Cash cryptocurrency to Satoshi's vision. We believe Bitcoin cash at the time of BCHDev's founding, is not the real bitcoin. We want to reform Bitcoin Cash until it does become *actually* Bitcoin. At some future point in the future, BCHDev's objects will have been met, and the group will then disband.

# People permanently banned from joining BCHDev:

* Greg Maxwell
* Peter Wuille
* Amaury Sechet
* Craig S. Wright (fake satoshi)

# People to are honorably founding members:

* Roger Ver
* Rick Falkvinge
* Anyone in the Bitcoin Unlimited group
