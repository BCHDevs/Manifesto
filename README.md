# Manifesto
The BCHDevs group exists to return the Bitcoin Cash cryptocurrency to Satoshi's vision. We believe Bitcoin cash at the time of BCHDev's founding, is not the real bitcoin. We want to reform Bitcoin Cash until it does become *actually* Bitcoin. At some future point in the future, BCHDev's objects will have been met, and the group will then disband.

# People permanently banned from joining BCHDev:

* Greg Maxwell
* Peter Wuille
* Amaury Sechet
* Craig S. Wright (fake satoshi)

# People to are honorably founding members:

* Roger Ver
* Rick Falkvinge
* Steve Sokolowski
* Anyone in the Bitcoin Unlimited group

(more honorary founders to come...)

# Roadmap

1. Gain "wallet consensus" on a modified cashaddr spec that reverts back to base58
1. Remove replay protection
1. Promote the usage of alternate names for currecy that trades using the symbol 'BTC': "Bitcoin Legacy", "Bitcoin Core", "BCore", etc.

# Rules of Membership

All users must remain completely anonymous. If someone else reveals your identity, that member is removed from the group and permanently banned.

Founding members are allowed to join the group usin the username BCHDev-name, where "name" is a pseudonym.
